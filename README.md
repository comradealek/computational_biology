# CSCI 451 - Computational Biology
A series of computational biology projects for CSCI 451 at Montana State University:

1.  **Z-algorithm**
    *   Linear time dynamic algorithm that finds a pattern string by scanning over the string being searched.

2.  **Global Align**
    *   A dynamic algorithm that finds the global alignment score of a pair of strings, measured with user defined values for insertion, deletion, matching and mismatching.

3.  **FM-Index Search**
    *   An algorithm that finds a substring within a string by using a sorted table of string suffixes. 

4.  **Center Star**
    *   An approximation algorithm for multi-string alignment.
